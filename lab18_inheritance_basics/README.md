# Lab 18: OOP - Inheritance Basics

## Objectives
- Understand inheritance in OOP.
- Extend a base class with a subclass.
- Override methods for specialized behavior.
- Use `super()` to access parent class methods.

## Summary
In this lab, we created a base class `Car` and extended it into a subclass `ElectricCar`.  
We demonstrated how subclasses can inherit attributes and methods from their parent, add new functionality (like `battery_size`), and override existing methods (`describe_car()`) to provide more detailed behavior.  

Errors encountered included missing Python packages and inactive services. These were resolved by installing Python, pip, venv, or activating Docker if needed. After fixes, all scripts executed correctly. This demonstrates how inheritance makes code reusable, organized, and easier to maintain.
