# Troubleshooting

1. **Error: No module named argparse**
   - Resolution: Ensure Python 3.x is installed (argparse is built-in).

2. **Script does nothing**
   - Resolution: Did you forget to run with `python greet.py`?

3. **Unknown arguments error**
   - Resolution: Double-check you typed `--name` correctly.

4. **Permission denied when running**
   - Resolution: Run with `python greet.py`, not `./greet.py`, unless file is marked executable.
