# Interview Q&A â€“ Lab 6: For & While Loops

**Q1. What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop in Python?**  
A: A for loop is used for a predetermined number of iterations, while a while loop continues until a condition is False.

**Q2. What does range(1, 6) produce?**  
A: Numbers from 1 to 5 (upper bound excluded).

**Q3. What happens if the while condition never becomes False?**  
A: It results in an infinite loop.

**Q4. Can you nest loops in Python?**  
A: Yes, loops can be nested inside each other.

**Q5. What is an example use case for a for loop?**  
A: Iterating through a list or fixed sequence of values.

**Q6. What is an example use case for a while loop?**  
A: Waiting for user input, polling, or accumulating values until a threshold.

**Q7. What is the output of range(5)?**  
A: Numbers 0 through 4.

**Q8. How do you break out of a loop early?**  
A: Use the `break` statement.

**Q9. How do you skip an iteration in a loop?**  
A: Use the `continue` statement.

**Q10. What error is common when using while loops?**  
A: Infinite loops due to missing updates of loop variables.
