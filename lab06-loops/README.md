# Lab 6 – For & While Loops

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how to implement and execute basic for and while loops in Python.
- Identify appropriate use cases for for and while loops.
- Learn to manipulate loop variables and control loop execution.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python syntax and variables.
- Python 3 installed (locally or in an online IDE).

## 🛠️ Tasks

### Task 1: For Loop Example
```python
# for_loop_example.py
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### Task 2: While Loop Example
```python
# while_loop_example.py
total = 0
i = 1

while total <= 20:
    total += i
    i += 1

print("Final total:", total)
```

### Task 3: Differences Recap
- **For Loop**: Predetermined number of iterations, iterates over sequences or ranges.
- **While Loop**: Executes while a condition is true, number of iterations not known in advance.

## ✅ Conclusion
In this lab, you learned the fundamentals of `for` and `while` loops in Python and when to use them.
