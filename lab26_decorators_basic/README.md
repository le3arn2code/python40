# Lab 26: Decorators - Basic Usage

## Overview
This lab introduces Python decorators, which allow you to wrap functions with extra functionality without modifying their core logic.

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of Python decorators and their syntax.
- Implement a simple decorator that logs before and after execution.
- Apply a decorator to a function using the `@` syntax.
- Recognize the benefits of decorators for logging, caching, and clean code.

## Files
- `lab26_task1_2.py` – Defines the decorator function.
- `lab26_task3.py` – Applies the decorator to a function.
- `notes.md` – Summary of decorator benefits.
- `commands.sh` – Commands used to run this lab.
- `troubleshooting.md` – Errors encountered and fixes.
- `interview_qna.md` – 10 interview-style Q&A.

## How to Run
```bash
python3 lab26_task3.py
```

## Summary
This lab demonstrated how decorators can log or extend functionality in functions without changing their definition. Decorators promote cleaner, reusable, and modular code structures.
