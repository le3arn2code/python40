# Python40 Labs 🚀

This repository contains a structured collection of **40 Python labs** designed to build practical programming skills step by step — starting from the basics and moving toward advanced scripting, debugging, testing, and CLI mini-projects.

## 📂 Structure of Each Lab
Each lab is self-contained and includes:

- **README.md** → Explains objectives, tasks, and conclusions  
- **commands.sh** → Key commands used in the lab  
- **troubleshooting.md** → Errors encountered and how they were resolved  
- **interview_qna.md** → 10 Q&A related to the lab for revision and interview prep  
- **Lab script(s)** → Python code implementing the lab

## 🗂 Labs Index
All labs are bundled into GitHub-ready packages with tags (`lab01`, `lab02`, … `lab40`) for easy navigation and tracking.
