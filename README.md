Python40 Labs ðŸš€

This repository contains a structured collection of 40 Python labs designed to build practical programming skills step by step â€” starting from the basics and moving toward advanced scripting, debugging, testing, and CLI mini-projects.

Each lab is self-contained and includes:

README.md â†’ Explains objectives, tasks, and conclusions.

commands.sh â†’ Key commands used in the lab.

troubleshooting.md â†’ Errors encountered and how they were resolved.

interview_qna.md â†’ 10 Q&A related to the lab for revision and interview prep.

Lab script(s) â†’ Python code implementing the lab.

All labs are bundled into GitHub-ready packages with tags (lab01, lab02, â€¦ lab40) for easy navigation and tracking.
