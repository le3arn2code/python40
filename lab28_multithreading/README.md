# Lab 28: Multithreading Basics

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of multithreading in Python.
- Learn how to create and manage threads.
- Recognize the shared memory model in multithreading.
- Identify potential concurrency issues inherent in multithreading.

## Lab Tasks
1. Import the `threading` module.
2. Define a function (`print_numbers`) to be executed by threads.
3. Create multiple threads using `threading.Thread`.
4. Start and join threads to ensure proper execution order.
5. Understand shared memory and concurrency issues such as race conditions.

## Conclusion
This lab introduced Python multithreading basics, including creating and managing threads, and recognizing potential concurrency issues. The key takeaway is that threads share memory, which requires careful handling to avoid race conditions.
