# Troubleshooting Lab 28

- **Issue: Threads output appears interleaved.**
  - This is expected behavior because threads run concurrently.

- **Issue: Python not found.**
  - Run `sudo apt install -y python3` to install Python.

- **Issue: ImportError for lab28_task1_2.**
  - Ensure `lab28_task1_2.py` is in the same directory as `lab28_task3_4.py`.
