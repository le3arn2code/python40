# Troubleshooting Lab 8: Tuples and Sets

## Issue 1: NameError: name 'fruits' is not defined
- Cause: Trying to use a variable before defining it.
- Fix: Define the tuple or set before calling methods on it.

## Issue 2: TypeError when modifying tuples
- Cause: Tuples are immutable, cannot be modified.
- Fix: Use lists if mutability is required.

## Issue 3: Duplicate values in sets
- Cause: Sets automatically discard duplicates.
- Fix: This is expected behavior.

## Issue 4: File not found when running script
- Cause: Wrong directory or missing file.
- Fix: Ensure `tuples_sets_example.py` is in the current directory.
