# Interview Q&A: Lab 8 Tuples and Sets

**Q1: What is a tuple in Python?**
A1: An immutable ordered collection used for fixed data.

**Q2: Why are tuples immutable?**
A2: For data integrity and to allow their use as dictionary keys.

**Q3: Give an example use case for tuples.**
A3: Storing coordinates `(x, y, z)` that should not change.

**Q4: What is a set in Python?**
A4: An unordered collection of unique elements.

**Q5: Can sets contain duplicates?**
A5: No, sets automatically remove duplicates.

**Q6: What is the difference between a list and a set?**
A6: Lists allow duplicates and maintain order; sets do not allow duplicates and are unordered.

**Q7: How do you add an element to a set?**
A7: Using the `add()` method.

**Q8: Can a tuple be used as a key in a dictionary?**
A8: Yes, because it is immutable.

**Q9: What happens if you try to modify a tuple element?**
A9: Python raises a TypeError.

**Q10: When would you use a set in real life?**
