# Troubleshooting

## 1. File not found error
- Ensure you run `write_file.py` before `read_file.py` so that `output.txt` exists.

## 2. Permission denied
- Make sure you have write permissions in the directory.

## 3. Output not showing
- Check that `output.txt` has content after running `write_file.py`.
