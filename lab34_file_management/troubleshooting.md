# Troubleshooting Lab 34

1. **Module Not Found Error**
   - Ensure you are running Python 3 (use `python3`).
   - Both `os` and `shutil` are standard libraries; no installation needed.

2. **No such file or directory**
   - Verify the source path is correct with `pwd` and `ls`.

3. **Permission denied**
   - Ensure you have read access to the source directory and write access to the destination directory.
