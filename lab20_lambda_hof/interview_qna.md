# Interview Q&A - Lab 20: Lambda & Higher-Order Functions

### 1. What is a lambda function in Python?
A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword.

### 2. How does the syntax of a lambda function look?
It uses: `lambda arguments: expression`.

### 3. When would you use a lambda function?
For short, throwaway functions that donâ€™t require a full `def` statement.

### 4. What is a higher-order function?
A function that takes another function as input or returns one.

### 5. How does `map` work in Python?
`map(function, iterable)` applies a function to each element of the iterable.

### 6. How does `filter` work in Python?
`filter(function, iterable)` keeps only elements for which the function returns True.

### 7. How does `reduce` work in Python?
`reduce(function, iterable)` applies the function cumulatively to reduce the iterable to a single value.

### 8. Why combine lambda with map/filter/reduce?
It allows concise inline definitions without needing separate functions.

### 9. What are benefits of lambda functions?
They create compact, readable code, especially with functional programming paradigms.

### 10. What are drawbacks of lambda functions?
They can be less readable for complex logic and are limited to single expressions.
