# Lab 20: Using Lambda & Higher-Order Functions

## Objectives
- Understand lambda functions and syntax in Python.
- Use higher-order functions: map, filter, and reduce.
- Implement practical examples with lambda.
- Highlight benefits of concise and readable code.

## Summary
In this lab, we explored **lambda functions** in Python and combined them with higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).  
We created a list of numbers, doubled them with `map`, filtered even numbers with `filter`, and calculated the sum using `reduce`.  

Errors encountered included missing Python installations. These were resolved by installing Python, pip, and venv (`sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv`).  
Once fixed, all scripts executed successfully.  

Lambda functions allow quick inline anonymous functions in one line, and when combined with higher-order functions, they provide powerful data processing capabilities with more concise and readable code.
