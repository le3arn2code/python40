# Lab 19: Basic Recursion Example

## Objectives
- Understand recursion in programming.
- Implement a recursive solution for factorial.
- Compare recursion with iteration.
- Explore tail recursion for efficiency.

## Summary
In this lab, we explored recursion using the factorial problem. We started with the concept of recursion (base case and recursive call), then implemented the factorial function recursively. We compared recursion with iteration to highlight differences in readability and efficiency. Finally, we implemented a tail-recursive factorial function and showed how iteration is better for large inputs to avoid stack overflow.

During setup, we ensured Python 3, pip, and venv were installed. Errors such as missing Python packages were resolved by installing them (`sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv`). After fixes, all scripts ran successfully.

This lab clearly demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of recursion: elegant solutions for small problems but potential inefficiency for large inputs. Iteration and tail recursion are more suitable for handling very large values of `n`.
