# Lab 15: Basic Debugging Techniques

## Objectives
- Understand and apply basic debugging techniques in Python.
- Learn how to use print statements effectively for debugging.
- Gain familiarity with the Python Debugger (pdb).
- Understand how to step through code execution and manage breakpoints.

## Tasks
1. **Using Print Statements for Debugging**  
   Insert print statements in a function to observe intermediate values.

2. **Introduction to Python Debugger (pdb)**  
   Add `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` to pause execution and inspect variables.

3. **Step Through Code Execution**  
   Commands: `n` (next), `s` (step), `c` (continue), `q` (quit).

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated the use of print debugging and pdb to track and fix errors in Python programs.
