# Troubleshooting

- **ZeroDivisionError**  
  Happens when dividing by zero. Fixed by testing input values.

- **ValueError**  
  Input conversion failure. Fixed by using `try-except`.

- **pdb not working properly**  
  Ensure you run with `python3` in a terminal, not inside restricted environments.

- **Software mismatch**  
  Always verify Python version >= 3.8 to ensure pdb features are available.
