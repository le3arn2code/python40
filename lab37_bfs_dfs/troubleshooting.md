# Troubleshooting - Lab 37 BFS/DFS

## Issues Encountered
1. Mistyped `[200~python3` instead of `python3`.
   - **Fix**: Retyped the command correctly.

2. Verified BFS and DFS implementations worked without additional errors.

## Lessons Learned
- Always double-check command syntax before execution.
- BFS requires a queue while DFS uses recursion/stack.
