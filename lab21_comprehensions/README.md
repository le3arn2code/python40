# Lab 21: List/Dict Comprehensions

## Objectives
- Use list comprehensions to create lists efficiently.
- Generate dictionaries with dictionary comprehensions.
- Compare comprehensions with traditional loops for readability and performance.

## Summary
In this lab, we demonstrated how to use **list and dictionary comprehensions** in Python.  
We created a list of squares using a list comprehension, built a dictionary mapping words to their lengths with a dictionary comprehension, and compared comprehensions to traditional loops.  

Errors encountered included missing Python tools. These were resolved by installing Python, pip, and venv (`sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv`).  
Once fixed, all scripts executed correctly and produced the expected results.  

Comprehensions simplify code, reduce errors, and can be faster due to Python’s internal optimizations. They make transformations and filtering more concise and readable, improving maintainability.
