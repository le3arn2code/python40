# Lab 22: Reading CSV Files

## Objectives
- Import and use the csv module in Python.
- Open a CSV file and read its content.
- Iterate over rows using `csv.reader()`.
- Handle CSV files with and without headers.
- Store CSV data in a list of dictionaries.

## Summary
In this lab, we explored how to work with **CSV files** in Python using the built-in `csv` module.  
We learned how to open files, read them using `csv.reader()`, handle cases with and without headers, and store the content into a structured format with `csv.DictReader()`.  

Errors encountered included missing Python installations. These were resolved by installing Python, pip, and venv (`sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv`). Once fixed, all scripts executed successfully.  

This lab demonstrates the essential skills required for data handling and manipulation. Understanding how to parse CSV files prepares you for real-world data tasks in analytics and software projects.
